# Product-Service Playground

## Overview
The Product-Service Playground is an Ionic project built with Angular. Its main purpose is to provide an isolated environment for testing and experimenting with a product-service. The service has been extracted from a larger project and is now used to evaluate the skills and knowledge of potential applicants.

This project allows users to view, edit, and create products within the isolated environment. It provides a simulated product-service API that can be easily modified and extended to suit the evaluation requirements.

## Scope
The scope of the Product-Service Playground includes the following functionality:

1. Display a list of products with basic information such as name, price, and availability.
2. View detailed information of a selected product.
3. Edit the details of an existing product.
4. Create new products with specified information.
5. Simulate API calls to retrieve, update, and create products.

Please note that this project is solely intended for evaluation purposes and should not be considered as a fully functional production application.

2. In the StackBlitz environment, you will see the project code and a preview of the application.

3. Click on the "Open in New Window" button in the top right corner of the preview to open the application in a separate tab.

4. Interact with the application by clicking on the products, editing their details, or creating new products.

5. The simulated API calls are automatically handled within the application, so you can focus on evaluating the desired aspects of the product-service.

6. Customize the service behavior by modifying the implementation of the service methods in the `src/app/services/product.service.ts` file. Save the changes, and the application will reflect the updated behavior.
