# Product-Service Playground

## Overview
The Product-Service Playground is an Ionic project built with Angular. Its main purpose is to provide an isolated environment for testing and experimenting with a product-service. The service has been extracted from a larger project and is now used to evaluate the skills and knowledge of potential applicants.

This project allows users to view, edit, and create products within the isolated environment. It provides a simulated product-service API that can be easily modified and extended to suit the evaluation requirements.

## Scope
The scope of the Product-Service Playground includes the following functionality:

1. Display a list of products with basic information such as name, price, and availability.
2. View detailed information of a selected product.
3. Edit the details of an existing product.
4. Create new products with specified information.
5. Simulate API calls to retrieve, update, and create products.

Please note that this project is solely intended for evaluation purposes and should not be considered as a fully functional production application.
To set up and run the Ionic project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:


## Prerequisites

To set up and run the Ionic project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Ionic CLI: After installing Node.js, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Ionic CLI globally:
  ```
  npm install -g @ionic/cli
  ```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Ionic project up and running:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Once the installation completes, you can start the development server by running:
   ```
   ionic serve
   ```
   This command will compile the project and open it in a web browser.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **src**: Contains the main source code of the Ionic application.
  - **app**: Contains the root component, modules, and services of the application.
  - **assets**: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, and icons.
  - **environments**: Contains environment-specific configuration files.
  - **theme**: Contains styling and theming-related files.
- **www**: The output directory where the compiled code resides. This directory is generated when you build the project for production.

Feel free to explore the project structure and make changes based on your application requirements.

## Available Commands

Here are some commonly used commands for the Ionic project:

- `ionic serve`: Starts the development server and opens the app in a web browser.
